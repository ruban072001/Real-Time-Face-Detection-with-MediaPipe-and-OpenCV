# Real-Time-Face-Detection-with-MediaPipe-and-OpenCV
This project performs real-time face detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The application detects faces from the webcam feed and draws bounding boxes around them with enhanced visual effects to highlight the corners. It also displays the detection confidence and calculates the frames per second (FPS) for real-time performance analysis.
